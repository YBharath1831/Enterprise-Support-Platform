"""
One Semantic Kernel instance, two registered chat services:
  "mini"     -> cheap/fast model, used by Intake + Triage (high volume, low complexity)
  "flagship" -> stronger model, used by Resolver + Critic (reasoning-heavy, must be careful)
Agents ask for a service by id rather than hardcoding a model, so swapping
models later (or live-swapping to Gemini for the multi-cloud demo) is a
one-line config change, not a code change.
