"""
The Triage/Orchestrator loop. This is the "loop engineering" centerpiece:
  - shared state object (TicketState) threaded through every agent
  - explicit max_turns so a stuck ticket can never loop forever
  - explicit exit conditions (auto_resolved, escalated, pending_human_approval, closed)
  - guardrails enforced here, not just trusted from the LLM's own output
  - fallback-to-human wired at two points: low RAG confidence, and critic-required review
Every step is persisted to Cosmos + audit-logged, so the pipeline is resumable
and the dashboard can show live progress mid-run.
